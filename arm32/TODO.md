1. qemu-system-arm in Ubuntu 16.04 does not support machine 'raspi2' ?

    see [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28880833/how-to-emulate-the-raspberry-pi-2-on-qemu)
    > -M raspi2 was added in QEMU 2.6.0, and Ubuntu 16.04 only has QEMU 2.5.0, so we have to compile QEMU from source

2. Windows Office on ARM chips
